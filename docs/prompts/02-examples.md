Generate practical examples for grove-claude-logs that demonstrate increasing complexity:

## Requirements
Create three distinct examples showing how to use grove-claude-logs in real-world scenarios:

1. **Example 1: Basic Usage** - Simple monitoring and inspection of Claude session logs
2. **Example 2: Advanced Analysis** - Using the Go library for programmatic analysis  
3. **Example 3: Workflow Integration** - Integrating grove-claude-logs with other Grove ecosystem tools; specifically, we use grove-flow to populate `interactive_agent` log markdown files with the Claude Code logs so that these implementation-related aspects of plan execution history is preserved.

## Structure
For each example, provide:
- Clear scenario description
- Step-by-step commands with expected output
- Explanation of what's happening
- Key insights or patterns demonstrated

## Context Integration
Reference how grove-claude-logs fits within the Grove ecosystem, particularly:
- How it works with grove-hooks for session monitoring
- Integration with grove-meta for unified CLI access
- Connection to grove-context for enhanced development workflows

Focus on practical, actionable examples that developers can immediately try in their own environments.
